## Welcome to DevExtreme + React + Webpack boilerplate
This application is greatly inspired by [DevExtreme](https://js.devexpress.com/) [official demo](https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-react-template/#/home). 
However this app is not a clone but a complete rebuild from scratch to allow a slightly different workflow.

The purpose of this project is to act as a boilerplate for a front-end React SPA built with DevExpress UI Kit. It is designed for enterprise type applications or backend (admin) apps. This focus affects some design approaches (e.g. the app is not greatly concerned about the bundle size and overall page load speed though there are several reasonable optimizations here and there).
